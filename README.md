# 👁️ README_NOT.md 👁️
Imagine visiting a project on github and finding a **README_NOT.md** besides the usual **README**. 

Which one would you open first? [Find out! (takes less than 10 seconds)](https://github.com/gilperopiola/grpc-gateway-impl)

We all open up the **README_NOT.md** because it piques our interest. And this gives us the opportunity to transmit whatever we write on that file directly to the focused and interested brain of our devs.

## Am I serious? 🧐

Well yes, kinda. Of course this isn't the gamechanger-coding-tip-of-the-decade-latino-subs.mkv, but it can be used to (from the top of my head):

- Give an overview on the project.
- List some good things to know about it.
- Say something nice to the reader, something funny, idk. Ask each dev to write a short weird description of the project. Or just ask GPT for ideas.
- If you're a company and have a lot of repos, doing this on each one and just being nice to the reader goes a long way. Branding / Company Culture.
- 🦔 Emojis are cute, you can add one or two.
- Promote your sister's onlyfans. Or yourself. It's free targeted marketing if you own a popular repo.
