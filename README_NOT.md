Imagine visiting a project on github and finding a README_NOT.md besides the usual README. 

Which one would you open first? [Find out! (takes less than 10 seconds)](https://github.com/gilperopiola/grpc-gateway-impl)

We all open up the README_NOT.md because it piques our interest. And this gives us the opportunity to transmit whatever we write on that file directly to the focused and interested brain of our devs.

## Am I serious?

Well yes, kinda. Of course this isn't the goat-gamechanger-structural-pattern of the year. But it can be used to (from the top of my head):

- Store a brief description of how the project works or some good things to know.
- Say something nice to the reader, something funny. You can ask each of the devs to give you a short weird description of the project. Ask GPT for ideas.
- If you're a company and have a lot of repos, doing this on each one and just being nice to the reader goes a long way. Like branding or identity.
